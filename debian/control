Description: mars kernel module.
 It generates and compare two builds using diffoscope.
 MARS Light is a block-level storage replication solution implemented
 in the form of a Linux kernel module.
 .
 It's almost a drop-in replacement for DRBD but it works
 asynchronously and over arbitrary distances using a technology
 similar to transaction logging of database systems.
